* Higher Categories in Agda
  This repo is a playground for experimenting with some ideas from
  higer category theory, building off the work in done [[https://github.com/agda/agda-categories][agda-categories]].
  There also might be some bits and bobs that could be upstreamed.

* Goals
  - [ ] T-MultiCategories from [[https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0305049][Higher Categories, Higher Operads]]
* Design Notes
  This repo aims to follow the design of agda-categories, with a few differences:
  - We should aim to use predicate versions of limits, rather than packing
    up the parameters in the records.
* Style Guide
  - Use ~𝒞, 𝒟, ℰ~ for Categories.
